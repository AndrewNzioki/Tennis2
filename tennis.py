In this project, we want to predict the ranking tier of a player based on the 
variables we have been given. We have many features so let us start

we want this to be a classification algorithm, so our y values will need to
be in classes, therefore we will need to encode the ranking variables in a way
that shows these classifications

Step 1: Extract, load and Transform Data

tennis = pd.read_csv("tennis_stats.csv")

#print info on the table
#print(tennis.info())

#there are no null values, so we can continue

We now want to do a calculation which lists the stats of a player over a period  
of years and groups them such that each player has a ranking and we can see all
the players with their rankings

We also know that this data is for players over a number of years, so we also 
count the number of years played

#Now we merge all the data
